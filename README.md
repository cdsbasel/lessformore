this repository presents the key findings of the "less for more" survey 2021

The University of Basel is committed to reducing CO2 emissions caused by academic plane travel by at least 30% over the next few years. As part of the project “Less for more” - Air Travel at the University of Basel, the Sustainability Office, in collaboration with the Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences (Prof. Dr. Rui Mata, BSc Nina Frings, BSc Sophia Prix, BSc Tamara Lotz), conducted a survey on the travel behavior of researchers and staff at the University of Basel. The goal of the survey was to gain a better understanding of the travel behavior of the University of Basel’s researchers and staff and inform future interventions that do not compromise excellence in science and teaching.
